# TFT-discord-bot-


The proposed project involves the development of a Discord bot for the game Teamfight Tactics (TFT) by Riot Games. TFT is a popular online multiplayer strategy game with in-game purchases, a ranking system, and frequent updates. The Discord bot will enable users to retrieve information from the Riot Games system and provide relevant game-related data in response to user commands.


Required Resources
require access to Riot Games' APIs to fetch real-time game data, so proper documentation and API key management will be essential.
In-Game Information: Access to TFT game data and APIs provided by Riot Games to fetch player rankings, match history, and other game-related information.
Images: Game-related images and icons for display within Discord.
Discord Bot Key: A Discord bot key to authenticate and connect the bot to a Discord server.
