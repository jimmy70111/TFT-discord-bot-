# TFT-discord-bot-


The proposed project involves the development of a Discord bot for the game Teamfight Tactics (TFT) by Riot Games. TFT is a popular online multiplayer strategy game with in-game purchases, a ranking system, and frequent updates. The Discord bot will enable users to retrieve information from the Riot Games system and provide relevant game-related data in response to user commands.
