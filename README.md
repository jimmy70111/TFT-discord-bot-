how to add API and fetch real time data

- give then API key I got from the company riot_api_key = 'RGAPI-44e82c49-1f92-4482-81e8-433d8c528f53'
- I can use import request(python) allowing the api to be used
- This allows  discord bot events and commands to fetch real time data.
  
  

how to compile?

- simply running the code provided in discord.py would turn the discord bot online which then you can do commands with it (note: this will only work with the bot being in your server)
